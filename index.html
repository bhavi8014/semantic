                <h1>AURORA</h1>
                <p>Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result
                from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter
                the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons,
                precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric
                constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both
                polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.Auroras are most commonly observed in the "auroral zone",[8] a band approximately 6° (~660 km) wide in latitude centered
                on 67° north and south.[9] The region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval". The oval is
                displaced by the solar wind, pushing it about 15° away from the geomagnetic pole (not the geographic pole) in the noon
                direction and 23° away in the midnight direction.[9] The peak equatorward extent of the oval is displaced slightly from
                geographic midnight. It is centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest
                toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun, which is called magnetic
                midnight.In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The southern counterpart, the
                aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously
                with changes in the northern auroral zone.[13] The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in
                Antarctica, the Southern Cone, South Africa, Australasia and under exceptional circumstances as far north as
                Uruguay.[14] The aurora borealis is visible from areas around the Arctic such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, the
                Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, Finland, Scotland, and Russia. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and
                south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes. On rare occasions, the aurora borealis can be seen as far
                south as the Mediterranean and the southern states of the US while the aurora australis can be seen as far north as New
                Caledonia and the Pilbara region in Western Australia. During the Carrington Event, the greatest geomagnetic storm ever
                observed, auroras were seen even in the tropics.</p>
